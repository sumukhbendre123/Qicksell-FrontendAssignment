# Frontend Assignment - React JS

## Overview

This project is a React JS application designed to demonstrate various frontend functionalities. The main objective is to create a responsive user interface that effectively displays state and manages user interactions.

## Features

- **Dynamic UI**: The application provides a dynamic user interface that responds to user input and changes in state.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's built-in state management to handle data flow and UI updates.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well across different screen sizes.
- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with various components, and the display will update accordingly.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/sumukhbendre123/Qicksell-FrontendAssignment)>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <Quicksell-FrontendAssignment>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
/src
  ├── /components        # Reusable components
  ├── /pages             # Application pages
  ├── /hooks             # Custom hooks
  ├── /context           # Context API for global state
  ├── App.js             # Main application file
  └── index.js           # Entry point
```

## Design

- **Components**: The application is built using reusable components to promote code reusability and maintainability.
- **Styling**: CSS modules or styled-components can be used for styling components, ensuring a scoped style to avoid clashes.

### Sample Component Structure

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './ComponentName.module.css';

const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  return (
    <div className="component-class">
      <h1>{prop1}</h1>
      <p>{prop2}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

## Display State

The display state will be managed using React's state and props. Below are key features of the display state:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state will be defined in each component using `useState` or the component's constructor (for class components).
   
   ```javascript
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
   ```

2. **Updating State**: State can be updated using event handlers to reflect changes in the UI.

   ```javascript
   const handleIncrement = () => {
     setCount(count + 1);
   };
   ```

3. **Conditional Rendering**: Components can render differently based on the state. Use conditional statements or ternary operators to manage this.

   ```javascript
   return (
     <div>
       {count > 0 ? <p>Count: {count}</p> : <p>No Count</p>}
       <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
     </div>
   );
   ```
